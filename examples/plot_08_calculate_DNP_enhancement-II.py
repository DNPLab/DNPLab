08 - Calculate DNP Enhancements (II)
====================================

This is a slightly more advanaced example demonstrating how to ingegrate multiple regions of an NMR spectrum and calculate the DNP enhancement for two different regions.
"""
# %%
# Load NMR Spectra
# ----------------
# In this example, we will load the aligned NMR spectra saved in one of the previous examples (:ref:`07_align_nmr_spectra`) and save it in the workspace (ws). This now includes the objects "proc", "NotAligned", and "Aligned", as well as the "raw" data.

# import dnplab as dnp

# file_name_path = "../data/h5/PowerBuildUpAligned.h5"
# ws = dnp.dnpImport.load(file_name_path)

# # %%
# # Integrate Calculate DNP Enhancement Factors
# # -------------------------------------------
# # Without the integral region the calculate_enhancement function will calculate the enhancement over the entire spectrum
# # First lets take a look at the data that is in the workspace

# print(ws.keys())

# # %%
# # We can see that there are four keys in the workspace: "Aligned", "NotAligned"," proc", and "raw".
# # %%
# # Now integrate First define the integral region


# ws.processing_buffer = "Aligned"

# dnp.dnpTools.integrate(ws, integrate_center = [2, 7], integrate_width = [1, 1])

# ws.processing_buffer = "proc"


# print(ws.keys())


# # dnp.dnpNMR.calculate_enhancement(ws, off_spectrum = 0)

# # # %%
# # # .. note::
# # #     The default behavior of the ``calculate_enhancement`` function is to use the first spectrum as the Off signal. If this is the case, the argument ``off_spectrum`` is not necessary unless you want to specify the slice that contains the off spectrum.
# # #     The ``calculate_enhancement``` function can also calculate the enhancement for specific regions of the spectrum. THis behavior will be discussed in the next example (:ref:`07_align_nmr_spectra`).

# # # %%
# # # If needed, access your array of enhancements as:
# # enhancements = ws["enhancement"].values

# # # %%
# # # Plot Enhancement Data
# # # ---------------------
# # # Finally, we can plot the enhancement data versus the microwave power.

# ws["integrals"].reorder(["power"])

# dnp.dnpResults.figure()
# # dnp.dnpResults.plot(ws["enhancement"],linestyle = '-', marker = 'o', fillstyle = 'none')
# dnp.dnpResults.plot(ws["integrals"])
# # dnp.dnpResults.plt.xlabel("Microwave Power (dBm)")
# # dnp.dnpResults.plt.ylabel("ODNP Enhancement Factor")
# dnp.dnpResults.plt.title("10 mM TEMPO in Toluene")
# dnp.dnpResults.plt.grid(True)
# dnp.dnpResults.show()
