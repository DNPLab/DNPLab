DNPLab Tools
============

DNPLab contains several tools to make day-to-day operation when running DNP experiments in the lab easier. These are little helper scripts and function to calculate the electron and nuclear Larmor frequency at a given magnetic field, or calculate the approximate magnetic field positions for specific radicals. Below is a gallery with different types of examples.
